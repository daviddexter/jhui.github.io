My name is Jonathan Hui. I started this blog to share my excitement about Deep Learning. Many articles here served as my personal notes. I wish some of the them give you better insights beyond the equations and also give you enough details to explore. 

For those intersted in connecting with me professionally, you can find me at Linkedin. For those want to explore more, you can ind my other articles in [medium.com/@jonathan_hui].
